# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** repository! 
This repository serves as a central space to document the requirements analysis process in software development projects.  

It includes research, specifications, user stories, and planning materials that guide the design and implementation of effective, user-centered solutions.  

The goal is to ensure clear alignment between project stakeholders, technical teams, and user needs.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.
### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- **Clarity and Understanding**: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- **Basis for Design and Development**: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- **Cost and Time Estimation**: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
